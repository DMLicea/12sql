* * Now use CREATE TABLE to create a table named "products". 

* * Our columns are item_id, product_name, department_name, price, and stock_quantity. This will represent the inventory.

* * Insert data into the table with INSERT INTO with the coulmn values product_name, department_name, price and stock_quantity.
